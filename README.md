# hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed

When I initially imported this I did something wrong and had to delete the repository and remake it. When I was cloning it it said a repo with the name already existed even when I kept deleting it from my computer. That's why this is named autodeployed1. Sorry about that - I'm not sure how to fix it.
